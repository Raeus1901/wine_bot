Absolutely easy to drink on its own but it begs for some meat and cheese.” Another fan, Richard S., calls it a “fantastic purchase from Saint-Émilion…a great vintner who has even beaten Lafite in blind tastings.”Handcrafted by the skilled team at Château Martet, this Bordeaux gem combines traditional winemaking with a focus on terroir. Its roots close to Saint-Émilion and Pomerol lend it a finesse and opulence that stands up to Bordeaux’s elite.

The blend of traditional Amarone grapes (Corvina, Rondinella, Oseleta, and Croatina) are dried for four months, followed by a slow fermentation with skin contact to produce Amarone’s unmatchable marriage of ripe plum flavors and silky tannin profile. Topped off with 36 months of aging in large-format oak casks, and finally rested in bottles, this red hits the perfect harmony note of power and poise!Italy’s Valpolicella region is renowned for being the birthplace of one of the most unique wine styles in history: Amarone. Produced from dried grapes, those potent, concentrated reds are the biggest wine style on the block in northeastern Italy. These are wines that make no apologies for being big, bold, and beautiful. And whenever Zenato (who Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate called “one of the historic names in Valpolicella”) releases a new Amarone vintage, Italian wine lovers are sure to take notice.

There’s the fact that the brand was founded by one of Spain’s top Sommeliers. There’s the fruit itself—Tinto Fino, Cabernet and Merlot—grown on coveted clay-rich limestone soils at nearly 2,000 feet in elevation (exactly where you want to be to balance ripeness and finesse). Finally, a custom fermentation system, designed by Rioja enologist Basilio Izquierdo, ensures every iota of flavor is extracted from grape to wine.

All the more reason to love the plummy, balanced, and elegantly spicy 2013 Gran Reserva from Finca Los Principes! This is the top-of-the-line release from this Silver Medal-winning label, at Rioja’s highest red wine quality tier, undergoing the region’s strictest requirements for grape yields, production, and aging. With this offer, you’re getting all of that high-end treatment, along with the concentration and quality that only Tempranillo from Finca Los Principes’s old vines can deliver.Awarded “Golden League Top Producer” in 2016 byDeutsche Wein Marketing, Bodegas Burgo Viejo (the winery behind the award-winning Finca Los Principes label), was founded in 1987 by six families of farmers, true stewards of the land who were dedicated to preserving Rioja’s time-honored winemaking techniques. This bodega can trace its roots back even further, however—to the 1950s, when they were a modest wine cellar selling off their cooperatively farmed grapes to other producers. Today, they are leading a new charge in Spain’s Rioja region, with a new generation coming on board (which will soon make Bodegas Burgo Viejo a company with sixteen families working together!) and young up-and-coming winemaking talents like standout Gorka Etxebarria.read more","oak, tobacco, vanilla | 42mentions ofoakynotes; black cherry, blackberr... | 29mentions ofblack fruitnotes; earthy, leather, smoke | 23mentions ofearthynotes; cherry, red fruit, more... | 20mentions ofred fruitnotes; pepper, licorice | 5mentions ofspicesnotes; citrus | 2mentions ofcitrusnotes; toast | 1mentions ofageingnotes; dried fruit | 1mentions ofdried fruitnotes; rhubarb | 1mentions ofvegetalnotes","Beef, Veal, Poultry, Game","oak, tobacco, vanilla | 42mentions ofoakynotes; black cherry, blackberr... | 29mentions ofblack fruitnotes; earthy, leather, smoke | 23mentions ofearthynotes; cherry, red fruit, more... | 20mentions ofred fruitnotes; pepper, licorice | 5mentions ofspicesnotes; citrus | 2mentions ofcitrusnotes; toast | 1mentions ofageingnotes; dried fruit | 1mentions ofdried fruitnotes; rhubarb | 1mentions ofvegetalnotes"

A classic Haut-Médoc Bordeaux red blend, this wine shows impressive style, depth, and character—enough for a wine costing five times as much, actually! Château Lamothe-Bergeron’s dedication to its craft and the quality of its wines can be seen clearly in the fact that they’ve brought on veteran consultants from Saint-Emilion legend Château Angélus ($350+) to advise in the cellar. This red might be the easiest (and most delicious) way to add class and elegance to your everyday drinking (and it costs a lot less than a tuxedo rental)!James Suckling: “There are attractive fresh red flowers here with a core of wild red berries. The palate has a succulent, smooth, easygoing and open feel. Drink now.”One of the most historic estates in the Médoc (with a history dating back to at least the 15th century), Château Lamothe-Bergeron achieved Cru Bourgeois Supérieur status in the 19th century (and again in 2020). Vines have been grown on the property since the 17th century, and the house once belonged to the Lauste and Martel families. Passed down through generations, it was eventually acquired by François Jacques Marie de Bergeron before changing hands many times, eventually bought gain and fully revitalized in 2019.read more","oak, vanilla, tobacco | 42mentions ofoakynotes; plum, black cherry, bla... | 26mentions ofblack fruitnotes; leather, earthy, salt | 25mentions ofearthynotes; cherry, red fruit, stra... | 15mentions ofred fruitnotes; pepper, musk, fennel | 4mentions ofspicesnotes; chard, tomato, arugula | 3mentions ofvegetalnotes; toast | 1mentions ofageingnotes; cheese | 1mentions ofyeastynotes; stone fruit | 1mentions oftree fruitnotes","Beef, Veal, Poultry, Game","oak, vanilla, tobacco | 42mentions ofoakynotes; plum, black cherry, bla... | 26mentions ofblack fruitnotes; leather, earthy, salt | 25mentions ofearthynotes; cherry, red fruit, stra... | 15mentions ofred fruitnotes; pepper, musk, fennel | 4mentions ofspicesnotes; chard, tomato, arugula | 3mentions ofvegetalnotes; toast | 1mentions ofageingnotes; cheese | 1mentions ofyeastynotes; stone fruit | 1mentions oftree fruitnotes"
